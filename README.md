# Motivation
Modern word search tools, while powerful, do not enable users to search for multiple words or phrases at a time. Along with this, if a user wants to find portions of a word or sentence and highlight them in different colors of their choosing, they are out of luck. After facing this exact dilemma myself while writing a research paper, I knew that if I wanted to see this functionality be implemented I would need to create an application that could support these very features, myself. 

# Frameworks
Expression Excavator is built using Google's Chrome Extention architecture, utilizing its Messaging and Tabs API for inter-application communication to drive the applications functionality. The application also uses the Mark.JS library to search for regular expressions in an extremely time effecient manner.

# Languages Used
*Application popup built using HTML, Javascript (JQuery, Mark.JS), & CSS3
*Background script build using Javascript (Chrome Messaging API, Chrome Tabs API)
